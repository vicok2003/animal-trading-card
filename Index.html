                <p>The name "gaint panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Thhough it belongs to the order carnivora, the gaint panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Gaint pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrubs leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
